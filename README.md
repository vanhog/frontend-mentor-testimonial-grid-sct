## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Even though, this was a "grid challenge", I chose for flexbox to handle the transition from the mobile to tablet view. I used flex-grow to achieve the given layout.

```  
.card-1 {
    flex: 1 0 16rem;
  }
  
```

### Continued development

Writing the same CSS- and HTML-code again and again is quite a bit painful. So, I'm looking forward to working with a framework.
